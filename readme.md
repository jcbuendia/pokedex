# React Native App Architecture
Mobile application architecture using React Native (CLI), Redux & Redux Saga using Flux as design pattern.

## Description
The main objective of this version of architecture is to use a structure similar to the one we use in the company to build web applications organized as mono-repo using Lerna.

In a future version it is intended to homologate and create their corresponding generators.

## Technology
* React
* React Native
* React Native CLI
* React Navigation
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* Immer
* Reselect
* Lodash
* Babel
* Eslint
* Prettier

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Having previously configured a mobile application development   environment for both Android and iOS, for this we recommend following step by step the guide on the official website in the [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) section.

To develop mobile apps you can use Windows, MacOS or Linux, it is important to mention that to create iOS apps it is 100% necessary to use MacOS.

### Dependencies
* Computer with Windows, MacOS or Linux and at least 8GB of RAM (16Gb recommended)
* Android or iOS emulator (MacOS required). A physical device can also be used
* Use Yarn to install project dependencies
* We recommend installing [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/releases) to debug the application in real time

## Run the application 
In a terminal run the cli using the following command
```
yarn start
```

in another terminal run the application using one of the following commands depending on the desired platform
```
yarn android
```
```
yarn ios
```
